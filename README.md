# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of 6 different machine learning models in order to predict credit risk.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.
